# laravel-sample-app

Sample Laravel application based on the RealWorld project.

---

### Laravel implementation of RealWorld app

This Laravel app is part of the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) project and an implementation of the [Laravel best practices](https://github.com/alexeymezenin/laravel-best-practices).

You might also check [Ruby on Rails version](https://github.com/alexeymezenin/ruby-on-rails-realworld-example-app) of this app.

See how the exact same Medium.com clone (called [Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io)) is built using different [frontends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=frontend) and [backends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=backend). Yes, you can mix and match them, because **they all adhere to the same [API spec](https://gothinkster.github.io/realworld/docs/specs/backend-specs/introduction)**

---

### How to run the API

Make sure you have PHP and Composer installed globally on your computer.

Clone the repo and enter the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarandb1107/laravel-sample-app.git
cd laravel-sample-app
